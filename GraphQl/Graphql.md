You are correct. In GraphQL, although the client can specify the exact data it needs in the query, the entire data is fetched from the server. GraphQL itself does not automatically reduce the data sent over the network; it only allows the client to be more precise in what it requests from the server.

The key distinction lies in how the client-side application constructs the query and how the server processes it:

1. **Client-Specified Queries:** GraphQL allows clients to specify the fields they need in a query. This means the client can avoid overfetching, where it requests unnecessary data, and can fetch only the required fields.

2. **Server-Side Data Resolution:** On the server side, the GraphQL server resolves the query and returns the requested data. The server is responsible for aggregating and fetching the data from various data sources, including databases, APIs, or other services.

While the entire data is still fetched from the server, the advantage of GraphQL is that it eliminates the problem of underfetching and overfetching, which are common in traditional REST APIs. Underfetching refers to situations where the client needs to make multiple requests to get all the data it needs, while overfetching refers to situations where the server sends more data than the client requires.

With GraphQL, the data is efficiently organized in a single query, reducing the number of requests needed to fetch related data and avoiding sending unnecessary data over the network. This results in more efficient data retrieval and a better overall performance for the client-side application.

It's important to note that while GraphQL improves data retrieval efficiency, other techniques, such as server-side pagination and batching, can further optimize the network communication and reduce data transfer. Additionally, caching strategies can be applied to avoid redundant network calls and enhance overall application performance.
